        <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
        <h2>Week 1: Setting Up My Blog</h2>
        <div class="week-entry">
            <p>This week, I created my blog page using HTML and hosted it on GitHub Pages. 
            This is the start in my road to becoming a better web developer. I spent time structuring 
            my blog to ensure it is easy to navigate and visually appealing. The Blog might change as I learn new tools and design 
            The goal of this blog is to document my progress and share insights as I learn new web development tools and technologies.</p>
            <p>To start, I have chosen two tools to focus on: <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. 
            Over the next two weeks, I will dive deeper into these technologies, experimenting with their features 
            and applying them in practical projects. These tools will enhance my ability to create efficient, modern, 
            and scalable web applications.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I have developed a rubric to evaluate each new tool I learn. This rubric will help me assess 
            ease of learning, real-world usefulness, performance, customization, community support, scalability, and 
            industry adoption. Using this structured approach, I aim to make informed decisions about which technologies 
            to integrate into my workflow.</p>
