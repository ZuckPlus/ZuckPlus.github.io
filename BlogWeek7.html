        <h1>Week 7: Learning PostgreSQL</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
            <p>This week, I started learning PostgreSQL as a step towards mastering more advanced database management systems like Firebase and Supabase. PostgreSQL is an open-source, and extensible SQL database that is widely used in production environments.</p>
            <p>It provides strong ACID compliance, advanced indexing techniques, and support for complex queries.
                Many companies use firebase or supabase as their database or a form of their database.  
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Basic Queries & Table Setup</h2>
            <p>Creating a table in PostgreSQL is similar to other SQL databases but with additional features.</p>
            <p>PostgreSQL supports JSON fields, full-text search, and advanced indexing, which makes it a strong candidate for future scalability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section excerpt">
            <h2>Next Steps: Firebase/Supabase</h2>
            <p>My next steps Will be to learn more in depth about Postgres but after understanding the snytax and flow of the db I will begin to learn supabase.
                Supabase is an open source alternative to firebase. Firebase is the google database. The goal of this 20% project is learn the basics of all the tools I will need
                to get a job in such a competetive market. I think so far I have been learning pretty fast because of my previous experience with the tools. But from now on the tools I will be learning are going to take a lot more time.
                I want to learn all of the basics of the top tools that are being used in competetive programing. It is hard to keep up though between learning tools that are already out then
                also trying to keep up with new releases and updates. 
            </p>
            <P>
                I want to after learning the fundamentals of all the resources used in software development, start to pick a tech stack.
                I will start to go over all the most popular tech stacks and then find one that I am most comfortable with. 
            </P>
