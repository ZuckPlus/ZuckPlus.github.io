        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fastify</h2>
            <p>Fastify is a web framework for Node.js that prioritizes speed and low overhead.
                 It is known for its efficiency, scalability, and ability to handle requests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why did I choose Fastify?</h2>
            <p>Compared to Express.js, Fastify provides improved performance due to its schema-based validation and optimized handling of requests. It is also highly extensible with its plugin architecture.
                I personally compared the speed between Fastify and Express.js with making a python script that locally enumlated users.
                I sent multiple requests from rotating proxies and there is a clear difference between Fastify and Express. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to start.</h2>
            <p>To set up Fastify, install it using npm:</p>
            <pre><code>npm install fastify</code></pre>
            <p>Then, create a simple server:</p>
            <pre><code>
const fastify = require('fastify')();
fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
    return { message: 'Hello, Fastify!' };
});
fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
            </code></pre>
        </div>

            <h2>Finding Jobs and Internships in Coeur d'Alene</h2>
            <p>As someone under 18, finding job opportunities in Coeur d'Alene is really tough.
                 Some common options are internships, part-time retail jobs, like at bobs IGA, and freelance tech work.
                 I have been offered to do the Wrangell sentinal website but they don't want to pay and from my understanding don't know the costs of what it takes to host a website.
                 I have a few free lance opertunities that I am pursuing but those only go so far. I like doing projects for people,
                 but I would like a reptuable job to start learning from. My goal is to find a job that I can get paid for to learn.
                 Then when I am 18 and ready to take on the responsibility that comes with working in software development in a company scenario I already have a headstart.
