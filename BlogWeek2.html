        <h2>Week 2: Learning Express.js</h2>
        <div class="week-entry">
            <p>This week, I focused on learning <strong>Express.js</strong>, a popular backend framework for Node.js. 
            Since I already have experience with front-end development, I wanted to explore the backend side of web applications, 
            where I can manage data, handle user authentication, and build APIs.</p>

            <h3>What is Express.js?</h3>
            <p>Express.js is a Node JavaScript framework that simplifies working with HTTP requests and responses. 
            Instead of manually setting up servers with raw Node.js, Express provides an easier way to define routes, 
            manage middleware, and structure applications efficiently. I really liked how easy it was
            to learn this framework. There is tons of documentation and videos explaining how this framework is different and how it is used.</p>

            <h3>ðŸ”§ Why I Chose Express.js</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is<strong>Minimal & Fast:</strong> Express doesnâ€™t add unnecessary complexity.</li>
                <li>It has<strong>Middleware Support:</strong> Easily extend features like authentication or logging.</li>
                <li>It has<strong>Routing System:</strong> Defines API endpoints in a structured way.</li>
                <li>It has<strong>Large Ecosystem:</strong> Many third-party packages are available.</li>
                <li>It is<strong>Industry Adoption:</strong> Used by companies like Uber and PayPal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My First Impressions</h3>
            <p>Getting started with Express was straightforward. With the easy access of knowledge
            I picked it up quick. I installed it using:</p>
            <pre><code>npm install express</code></pre>
            <p>Then, I created a simple server using Express. </p>
            <pre><code>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>This was my first hands-on experience setting up a server in Express, and I already see why Express is widely used.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <p>After learning the documentation and how much Express deals with middleware I did see some concerns.
            I could see how there could be security risks in the future if its not configured right. After doing more then just a few hours
            of research on security with Express msot of them time its combined with another framework. Most commonly Fastify. Fastify is
            much more effecitant with memory and handling large requests then transfering it to another place.</p>
