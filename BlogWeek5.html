        <div class="section">
            <h2>Complexity of Integrity Checks & Role-Based Access</h2>
            <p>One of the hardest parts of building a standalone API is implementing proper integrity checks and making sure users have the correct permissions. Verifying whether an admin is actually an admin vs. a regular user requires role-based access control,This is also known as RBAC. which has to be built securely from scratch.</p>
            <p>The API needs to validate user credentials, generate a secure token, and ensure those tokens are not tampered with. A common solution is using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) signed with a secret key.</p>
            <pre><code>
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const token = jwt.sign({ role: 'admin' }, 'secret_key', { expiresIn: '1h' });
            </code></pre>
            <p>Making sure users cannot escalate privileges,for example like a person who just has the role of "user" that could maliciously attempt to gain admin access to the backend/server. This requires validation on each request.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Handling Multiple Connections from Different Locations</h2>
            <p>A challenge that can make or break new devleopers is handling multiple connections. A poorly designed API might allow unauthorized access due to CORS misconfigurations or improper rate limiting.</p>
            <p>To handle this, we can implement middleware that validates request origins and limits access based on region or IP.</p>
            <pre><code>
const rateLimit = require('fastify-rate-limit');
fastify.register(rateLimit, {
    max: 100,
    timeWindow: '1 minute'
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>We also need to ensure our API supports concurrency properly, preventing race conditions where multiple users try to modify data simultaneously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section excerpt">
            <h2>Simulating Real-World API Connections</h2>
            <p>To test the API under real-world conditions, we can use a Python script with rotating proxies from different regions. By sending requests from various locations, we can verify how well the API handles authentication and rate limiting.
                We can also disable security measures on a local client runnning the server. Then using that python script simulate different users requesting or upload data to the same vairables or really just any general informaiton. 
                For example uploading files to the server from the api.

<h2>Next I plan to?</h2>
<p>There is a few things I am wanting to do next. I in an earlier blog mentiond finding a job for the field I want when I move to Idaho.
    The problem with that is I don't know exactly which part around the north area that I will be moving to. So I wouldn't want to get a job early
    then have to commute to work an hour + every single day. I want to work on adding multi threading to my api that ive been making for this blog.
    While I was making this api I wasn't exactly sure what I was wanting this to be. Right now its just been an authentication and uploading files.
    I have preivously made a google drive sort of alternative that you can host on a computer thats on your local network then you make a rule in your firewall to let
    other people have access it but its not broadcasted to the public. I would like to make something different then this. I was sort of thinking a authentication that 
    servers for the backend of an c++ loading or installing program.
