            <h2>Progress report</h2>
            <p>I have ran into a lot of trouble recently. I thought that I knew enough about networking that I could first make a proof of concept (poc) without having to learn a whole lot of extra information and utilize other tools.
                I was extremely wrong. I am learning a lot about cloudflare which I thought I knew enough about but I did not. More specifically DNS settings and anti ddos settings. Along with firewall rules etc. Pairing cloudflare with my VPS that I purchased for this project and the domain has been a tough challenge.

            <h2>UI/UX</h2>
            <p> To speed up the workflow and process of creating an entire ecosystem I have utilized AI. Now generally speaking AI is not very good at writing code from my experience but with 
                cursor + claude 3.7 Thinking it suprised me. I had to hold its hand the entire time but it still probably took a month off the expected time I was thinking for finishing this project.
                I told it my tech stack, MySQL for the database, Node JS/Fastify for the backend, and react js for the front end. React previously didn't like my computer and wouldn't install, but I found a post on redit of all places that helped me fix this problem.
                AI also helped generate ideas for the backend but it would fail to generate code due to it mostly not understanding the complexity of my integrity and security checks.

            <h2>ETA</h2>
            <p> I hope to finish the basic concept of the functionality by next weekend. I work on this project alteast a couple hours a day, and plan on actually using this project after being done with the proof of concept.
                So far we have ran into a lot of issues but everyone runs into issues when developing. This has pushed me into having to learn quickly and not just skip on through. Usually a project of this size will have a team of developers.
                Well I have a few people I can ask for help on certain things, I am still doing this project completely by myself.
