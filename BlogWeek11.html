            <h2>My own enclosed ecosystem</h2>
            <p>I am making an enclosed ecosystem. The best explanation of an ecosystem in the tech world is when you have a lot of systems or projects that can all communicate and interact. The goal is to make all these systems communicate and interact seamlessly. The best example of an enclosed ecosystem would be something like Apple. The way that Apple AirPods, iPhones, and MacBooks all communicate with each other is through a protocol. This protocol is private—other headphone companies don’t have access to this secret protocol—but it’s on every single device because it’s built into the operating system. This is why there is no real competing headphones with AirPods for iPhones. In order to release something on the App Store, you have to pay to get a license to the Apple program compiler for Xcode. This means you have to pay to get access to publishing any application on Apple. On top of paying for the ability to use Apple’s App Store, you have to sign a contract with the bare minimum agreement that Apple takes 30% of all in-app purchases.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p> I am making this ecosystem not exactly like Apple, but in a similar way. To explain my version: this will be an ecosystem meant for developers to release their products on, without having to worry too much about security.
                For developers who need to sell licenses to access their products, I take care of that too. I won’t be like Apple and take a percentage of your money—maybe in the future, if this project is released and makes bank, I will. But for right now, it’s free to use.
                I don’t have a security protocol in place yet, but I will be implementing role-based access. Paired with dynamic web app routing, I can build a system where developers can not only distribute licenses for themselves, but also allow official third-party resellers. These resellers will be able to sign up on my website and receive discounts on licenses to distribute on their own.

            <h2>Struggles so far</h2>
            <p> I’ve used some AI to help me get boilerplate code out of the way. This has sped up the amount of work I’m able to accomplish during the small window of time I have to code each day.
                I ran into a few issues, though. AI doesn’t fully understand undocumented code. This means when I’m asking it to transfer over code I made from a previous project to a new one, it sometimes doesn’t use the functions correctly. Which is fine—I can always fix it pretty easily.
                One of the bigger issues I ran into was that the AI had implemented bcrypt instead of SHA-256. During the initial testing phase, the login function wasn’t working. After about 8 hours of debugging, I realized I was hashing my password twice. I had been doing so much debugging that I actually created more errors for myself.
                I was even doing fallback API calls because I thought maybe the login was failing due to a security header or CORS issue. I eventually fixed it, and now it works perfectly fine.
