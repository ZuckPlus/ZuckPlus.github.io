            <h2>My own enclosed ecosystem</h2>
            <p>I am making an enclosed ecosystem. The best explanation of an ecosystem in the tech world is when you have a lot of systems or projects that can all communicate and interact. The goal is to make all these systems communicate and interact seamlessly. The best example of an enclosed ecosystem would be something like Apple. The way that Apple AirPods, iPhones, and MacBooks all communicate with each other is through a protocol. This protocol is private—other headphone companies don’t have access to this secret protocol—but it’s on every single device because it’s built into the operating system. This is why there is no real competing headphones with AirPods for iPhones. In order to release something on the App Store, you have to pay to get a license to the Apple program compiler for Xcode. This means you have to pay to get access to publishing any application on Apple. On top of paying for the ability to use Apple’s App Store, you have to sign a contract with the bare minimum agreement that Apple takes 30% of all in-app purchases.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p> I am making this ecosystem not like apple but in the same sense. To explain my version this will be a ecosystem meant for developers to release products on but not have to worry to much about security.
                For developers who need to sell licenses to access their products I take care of that too. I won't be like apple and take a percent of your money, maybe in the future if this project is released and makes bank I will. But for right now its free to use.
                I don't have a security protocal either but I will be doing a Role based access, paired with web app dnymiac routing I can make a system where Developers can not only distrbute licenses for them selves. But if they have 3rd party offical resellers they can make have resellers
                sign up on my website and then get a discount on licenses to distribute themselves.

            <h2>Struggles so far</h2>
            <p> I have used some AI to help me get boiler plate code out of the way. This has speed up the amount of work im able to acomplish during my small window of time I have to code each day.
                I ran into a few issues though. AI doesn't fully understand non documented code. This means when Im asking it to transfer over the code that I made from a previous project to 
                this new one it sometimes doesn't use the functions right. Which is fine I can always fix it pretty simple. One of the huge issues I ran into was that the AI had implemented bycrypt instead of SHA 256.
                Well during the first initial testing phase the login function was not working. After about 8 hours of debugging I had realized that I was hashing my password twice. I had been doing so much debugging that I created more errors for myself.
                I had been doing fall back api calls because I thought if the login was failing maybe it was a security header or CORS issue. I eventually fixed it and now it works perfeclty fine.
